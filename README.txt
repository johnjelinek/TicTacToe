Coding challenge: a tic-tac-toe game. You can write it in any language you'd like, using any sort of interface you'd like (text/console-based is fine). At a minimum, the game should:
- allow a human player to play against a computer player.
- the computer player should never lose, only tie. It should always take a win if possible.
- allow the human player to select to go either first or second.
